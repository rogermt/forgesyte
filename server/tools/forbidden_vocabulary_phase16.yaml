# Phase 16 Forbidden Vocabulary Configuration
# 
# This file defines vocabulary and concepts that are forbidden in Phase 16
# functional code. These concepts are reserved for Phase 17+ scope.

# Date: 2026-02-14
# Phase: 16 - Asynchronous Job Queue + Persistent Job State + Worker Execution

# Forbidden Terms (Phase 17+ concepts only - Phase 16 specific)
# 
# NOTE: This list focuses on NEW Phase-17 patterns that should not enter Phase 16 code.
# Pre-Phase-16 vocabulary (websocket, streaming, sse, real_time from earlier phases)
# is excluded because they exist in existing protocols and are allowed in Phase 16.
