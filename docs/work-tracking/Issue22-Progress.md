  - Validates responses and creates backups
  - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with fixture sync documentation

### In Progress
(None)

### Blocked
(None)

### Todo
- [ ] WU-7: Update Server Tests - conftest.py Mocks (1.5 hours)
- [ ] WU-8: Documentation - Update CONTRIBUTING.md (1 hour)
- [ ] WU-9: Documentation - Create Test Guide (1.5 hours)
- [ ] WU-10: Audit & Verification (1 hour)

## Current Work Unit: WU-6
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Deliverables**:
  - `scripts/sync-fixtures.sh` - Automated fixture sync script
  - Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with Testing Strategy section
  - Documented fixture synchronization workflow
  - Script handles server startup/shutdown, error handling, validation

---

## WU-6 Details

### What Was Done
1. Created `scripts/sync-fixtures.sh` with:
   - Server startup/shutdown handling
   - API endpoint calls for jobs, plugins, health
   - Response validation
   - Fixture backup creation
   - Colored status output
   - Error handling and cleanup

2. Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include:
   - Testing Strategy section
   - Mock factories usage examples
   - Golden fixtures documentation
   - Fixture synchronization instructions
   - Integration testing examples
   - Checklist for adding tests

3. Documentation references:
   - Updated fixtures/README.md already has sync script reference
   - Added link to AGENTS.md for detailed mock best practices

### Script Features
- Starts local test server
- Waits for server readiness with retry logic
- Calls `/v1/jobs`, `/v1/plugins`, `/v1/health` endpoints
- Validates JSON responses
- Backs up previous fixtures with timestamp
- Pretty-prints output JSON
- Cleans up on exit (kills server, removes temp files)
- Color-coded status messages
- Comprehensive error handling

### Usage
```bash
./scripts/sync-fixtures.sh
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+ with uv
- Server dependencies installed (`uv sync` in server/)
- Curl for HTTP requests
- Python3 with json module

## Branching Strategy

Each work unit uses feature branch pattern:

```
main
  ↑
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-1 (golden fixtures) ✅
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-2 (mock factories) ✅
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-3 (joblist tests) ✅
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-4 (other tests) ✅
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-5 (integration tests) ✅
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-6 (sync script) ✅ [CURRENT]
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-7 (server test mocks)
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-8 (contributing docs)
  ├─ feature/issue-22-wu-9 (testing guide)
  └─ feature/issue-22-wu-10 (audit)
```
