# ⭐ Phase 8 — Metrics, Normalisation, Overlays, Performance

**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Roger  
**Depends on:** Phase 7 (Closed)  
**Blocks:** Phase 9  

Phase 8 establishes the observability, normalisation, and overlay systems required for a production‑grade vision platform.  
This milestone focuses on metrics, structured logging, result normalisation, overlay rendering, FPS controls, and device selection.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Add structured metrics across the entire job pipeline  
- Introduce unified result normalisation for all plugins  
- Build a unified overlay rendering system  
- Add FPS and performance controls  
- Add device selector logic (CPU/GPU)  
- Strengthen governance and CI guardrails  

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- Metrics layer (server + plugin + job pipeline)  
- Structured logging (server + plugin)  
- Normalisation layer for all plugin outputs  
- Unified overlay renderer (players, ball, pitch, radar)  
- FPS throttling + performance safeguards  
- Device selector logic  
- Phase 8 CI guardrails

## 📌 Transition Note

Phase 7 is closed.  
The system is stable, predictable, and ready for forward development.  
Phase 8 begins now.
